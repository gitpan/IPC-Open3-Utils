Revision history for IPC-Open3-Utils

0.91 Sun Dec  1 12:38:58 2013
    - rt 67389: remove handles from IO::Select when we hit their eof and close them (thanks SCOTT)

0.9  Sun Dec  1 12:00:55 2013
    - rt 91094
        - fixed $! errouneously set to 9
        - child_error_exit_value() factor in child_error_failed_to_execute()
        - open3 error is from eval so we can't avoid “ … at …”
        - avoid uninit warning
        
0.8  Fri May 21 05:33:21 2010
    - catch open3 fatalities better (prompted by CPAN reports)
    - POD typo

0.7  Tue May 18 23:17:12 2010
    - rt 57609: add 'timeout' attributes
    - handler fatalities caught and put in $@
    - rt 57612: support array and code ref in pre_read_print_to_stdin
    
0.6  Wed May  5 23:15:58 2010
    - drop wrapper script (and related child_error[_] args hr keys), it is not needed to get $? and $! properly
    - document pre_read_print_to_stdin
    - perltidy
    - when cmd is empty set $? to 65280 like system()

0.5  Mon May 18 21:23:49 2009
    - check for "stderr weirdness" situation and skip tests for now, added TODO for more investigation
    - moved 'ignore_handle' logic to after the read to eliminate possibility it'd block (but it's still ignored of course)
    - added 'pre_read_print_to_stdin' key
    - do locale SIG PIPE to be able to close handles when the command does SIG PIPE to avoid silently killing your script via race 
        (print to command's stdin after it's exited)

0.4  Sat May 16 14:21:57 2009
    - tests, use $^X instead of hardcoded path, hack to fix timing issue on certain systems
    - waitpid() call to after close()
    - Added TODO list

0.3  Thu Dec 11 19:27:53 CST 2008
    - 00.load.t - just skip all when unprivileged to avoid mis calculation/run of tests
    - 00.load.t - try and account for IO::Select behavior and single output ref results in tests
    - 00.load.t - invoke perl in tests as $^X to address 'Can't locate Devel/Autoflush.pm in @INC' and friends
    - 00.load.t - comment out unnecessary (for now) eval/skip just to be on the safe side
    - 00.load.t - add ';' to end of a SKIP block w/out one just to be on the safe side
    
0.2  Tue Dec  9 22:49:42 2008
    - EXPORT info to POD
    - run_cmd() and put_cmd_in() exported by default
